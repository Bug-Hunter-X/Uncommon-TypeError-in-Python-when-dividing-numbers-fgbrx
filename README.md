This repository contains a Python code example that demonstrates an uncommon error scenario. The code shows how a TypeError can be raised during division operation even if both operands are numbers but of different numeric types. The solution shows how to explicitly raise TypeError when the operands are not of the same numeric type in a cleaner way.
